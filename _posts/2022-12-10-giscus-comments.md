## Graph Neural Network (GNN)
Here are the details about GNN:
* [An introduction about GNN in wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network)
* [Applications of GNN are introduced here.](https://neptune.ai/blog/graph-neural-network-and-some-of-gnn-applications)
* [*Kipf et al. 2017*  proposed the first GNN architecture.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)

My work mainly focus on:
* Develop faster and more capable GNN.
* Graph Learning for generalization.
* Graph out-of-distribution.
* GNNs' applications on biology and chemistry.
* Dynamic GNN on different conditions.
* Evolution of the GNN.
* Graph Transformer.
