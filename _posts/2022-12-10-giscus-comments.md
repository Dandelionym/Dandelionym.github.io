### Graph and Intelligent Transportation Systems (2021)
>The needs of modern life, rapid growth of population, urban sprawl, air pollution, and other environmental problems cause several issues in transportation systems, and intelligent approaches have been applied to resolve them in an efficient manner.
Intelligent approaches to improving and optimizing transportation-related services include unlocking hidden knowledge and patterns in increasingly spatiotemporal and crowdsourced information collected from various sources, such as mobile phone sensors, vehicle telemetric, Bluetooth-enabled devices, and Twitter.

> Machine learning is one element of Artificial Intelligence, where computers can self-teach and improve their performance of specific tasks. Complementary to machine learning processes are knowledge graphs, which offer a way to model any domainâ€™s data with the help of experts, interlink data, automate responses, and scale intelligent decisions. Specifically, knowledge graphs and machine learning include techniques for describing and analyzing transport data and extracting useful knowledge on traffic conditions and mobility behaviors.

> This Special Issue aims to provide the most recent advances in knowledge graphs and machine learning techniques on intelligent transportation systems as well as to bring knowledge graphs and machine learning together to intelligent transportation system applications and extend their range of capabilities.

### Graph and Bioinformatics (2022)

> Molecular biology is concerned with enumerating and characterizing all the building blocks of living systems, as well as with their relationships, how the properties and the activity of one element affects those of another. For example, certain proteins have the capability of binding to particular regions of a cell's DNA, thereby activating or inhibiting the transcription of messenger RNA that codes for another protein, or even for that protein itself. Many proteins have the capability of binding to other proteins, forming a complex that can perform actions that none of the individual constituent proteins would be able to do. There are thousands, perhaps millions of different types and states of proteins in a living organism, and the number of possible interactions between them is enormous. The language of graph theory offers a mathematical abstraction for the description of such relationships. The beauty and usefulness of this abstraction is that it allows to develop concepts and tools independent of the concrete application. Many scientists and engineers are familiar with the benefits of abstraction that lie in linear algebra, calculus or probability theory; the goal of this article is to demonstrate some of the scope and power of the theory of graphs for the biology of gene regulation.

> A graph consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that connect the nodes. The nodes are the entities of interest and the edges represent relationships between the entities. For example, the entities may be a set of proteins in a cell, and the relationship modeled may be the existence of a physical interaction between two proteins. A graph is specified by the set of nodes V the set of edges E. Each element of E contains a pair of elements of V. Edges can be assigned weights, directions, and types. Sometimes, specialized forms of graphs such as multigraphs, bipartite graphs and hypergraphs are useful.

> We will use the terms graph and network interchangeably, the former stressing the mathematical concept, the latter the applications.
