### About

In 2019, he authored a collection of poems titled *Season of the Rain*, and in 2020, he followed up with a collection of prose titled *Remember the Snow*. His literary prowess was recognized when he won first prize in the National Youth Writing Competition in 2020. From 2018 to 2021, he held the position of **Executive Vice Chairman at Tinder Literature**, where he oversaw the publication of several of his literary works both online and in print.

In addition to his achievements in the field of literature, he is also a highly skilled **Software Engineer**. In 2021, he developed a web-based system for online cooperation aimed at promoting knowledge sharing in society. He also designed the Intelligent Assisted Diagnosis System for Bladder Cancer Imaging, a widely-used remote diagnosis tool, as well as four other widely-utilized web systems.

[//]: # (He earned a B.S. degree in software engineering from YNU in China, where he pursued his passion for research under the guidance of Prof. Cheng Xie and his one-year research on Industrial Network Data Mining and Graph Learning proved to be highly productive. He then embarked on a two-year research project on Bladder Cancer Imaging Analysis, working with Researcher [Chunming Guo]&#40;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lI82lJUAAAAJ&#41; and later collaborating with Prof. [Lin Yang]&#40;https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/lin-yang.html&#41; on a similar topic.)

Mellen Y.Pu is a Ph.D. student in the School of Engineering at Westlake University, under the mentorship of **Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Prof. [Hongyu Chen](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/hongyu-chen.html)** and **Prof. [Tao Lin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tao-lin.html)**. 

His main research interest is **<u>Data Efficient Learning in Science</u>**, focusing on modeling structured data and applications of deep learning methods. He looks forward to long-term cooperation and extensive exchanges on **<u>AI + Material Science / Biology</u>**.
