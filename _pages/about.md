For the past four years, I majored in software engineering at Yunnan University and obtained a B.S. degree in engineering. Followed by Master Tutor, Associate Prof. Cheng Xie, I did one-year research about Industrial Network Data Mining and Graph Learning. Followed by [Researcher, Doctoral Supervisor, Chunming Guo](http://www.ynusky.ynu.edu.cn/yunlifesci/yjz/guochunming.htm), I did two-year research about Bladder Cancer Imaging Analysis, later I followed [Doctoral Supervisor, Prof. Lin Yang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/lin-yang.html) with a similar research topic. Now, I am studying for a Ph.D. in the School of Science, Westlake University, following **[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Doctoral Supervisor, Prof. Hongyu Chen](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/hongyu-chen.html)**. I'm also in the [LINs Lab](https://lins-lab.github.io/) as a joint student, following [Doctoral Supervisor, Prof. Tao Lin](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tao-lin.html).

My main research interest is **AI for Nanoscience & Biology**, focusing on modeling structured data and applications of deep learning methods.
