I'm a poet that wrote a collection of poems named *season of the rain* in 2019 and a collection of prose named *Remember the Snow* in 2020. I won first prize in the National Youth Writing Competition in 2020, at the same time, I also served as the executive vice chairman of Tinder Literature from 2018 to 2021. Several literary were published online and in presses.

I'm also a software engineer, who developed a knowledge-society-oriented web system named **CentPrime** for online cooperation in 2021, the *Intelligent Assisted Diagnosis System of Bladder Cancer Imaging* for remote diagnosis and other 4 widely-used web systems.

From 2018 to 2022, I majored in software engineering at Yunnan University and obtained a B.S. degree in engineering. Followed by Master Tutor, Associate Prof. Cheng Xie, I did one-year research about Industrial Network Data Mining and Graph Learning. Followed by [Researcher, Doctoral Supervisor, Chunming Guo](http://www.ynusky.ynu.edu.cn/yunlifesci/yjz/guochunming.htm), I did two-year research about Bladder Cancer Imaging Analysis, later I followed [Doctoral Supervisor, Prof. Lin Yang](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/lin-yang.html) with a similar research topic. Currently, I am studying for a Ph.D. in the School of Science, Westlake University, following **[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Doctoral Supervisor, Prof. Hongyu Chen](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/hongyu-chen.html)**. I'm also in the [LINs Lab](https://lins-lab.github.io/) as a joint student, following [Doctoral Supervisor, Prof. Tao Lin](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tao-lin.html).

My main research interest is **AI for Nanoscience & Biology**, focusing on modeling structured data and applications of deep learning methods. I look forward to long-term cooperation and extensive exchanges.
