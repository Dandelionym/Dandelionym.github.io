In 2019, he authored a collection of poems titled *Season of the Rain*, and in 2020, he followed up with a collection of prose titled *Remember the Snow*. His literary prowess was recognized when he won first prize in the National Youth Writing Competition in 2020. From 2018 to 2021, he held the position of **[Executive Vice Chairman at Tinder Literature](http://zghaowx.com/)**, where he oversaw the publication of several of his literary works both online and in print.

In addition to his achievements in the field of literature, he is also a highly skilled **[Software Engineer]()**. In 2021, he developed a web-based system for online cooperation aimed at promoting knowledge sharing in society. He also designed the Intelligent Assisted Diagnosis System for Bladder Cancer Imaging, a widely-used remote diagnosis tool, as well as four other widely-utilized web systems.

He earned a B.S. degree in software engineering from YNU in China, where he pursued his passion for research under the guidance of Associate Professor Cheng Xie and his one-year research on Industrial Network Data Mining and Graph Learning proved to be highly productive. He then embarked on a two-year research project on Bladder Cancer Imaging Analysis, working with [Researcher and Doctoral Supervisor Chunming Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lI82lJUAAAAJ) and later collaborating with [Doctoral Supervisor Professor Lin Yang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/lin-yang.html) on a similar topic.

Currently, he is pursuing a PhD in the School of Science at Westlake University (WIAS), under the mentorship of **[Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and Doctoral Supervisor Professor Hongyu Chen](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/hongyu-chen.html)**. As a joint student in the [LINs Lab](https://lins-lab.github.io), he is also working with [Doctoral Supervisor Professor Tao Lin](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/faculty/tao-lin.html) to further his research in his field of interest.

His main research interest is **<u>Data efficient learning</u>**, focusing on modeling structured data and applications of deep learning methods. He looks forward to long-term cooperation and extensive exchanges on **<u>AI + Chemistry/Biology</u>**.
